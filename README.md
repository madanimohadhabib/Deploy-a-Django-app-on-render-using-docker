# Deploy-a-Django-app-on-render-using-docker
This guide will help you deploy a Django web application on [Render](https://render.com/ "Render") using Docker containers. Render is a cloud platform that simplifies deployment, scaling, and hosting of web applications.
## Prerequisites
* A Django web application (if you don't have one, you can follow the [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial01/ "Django tutorial")).
* A [GitHub](https://github.com/ "GitHub") account for version control.
* A [Render](https://render.com/ "Render") account to host your application.

1. Log in to your Render account.
2. Click on "New" and select "Service."
3. Choose a name for your service and select the GitHub repository where your Django app is hosted.
4. Render will automatically detect your app's language and provide a build environment. Make sure it's set to "Docker."
5. Configure the following environment variables in the "Environment" section:
    * DJANGO_SECRET_KEY: Your Django app's secret key.
    * DJANGO_DEBUG: Set to False for production.
    * Other necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection details).
6. In the "Build" section, use the following Dockerfile:
```Dockerfile

#Use the official Python image as the base image
FROM python:3.8

#Set environment variable for unbuffered Python output
ENV PYTHONBUFFERED=1

#Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /django

#Copy the requirements file into the container
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt

#Install project dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

#Copy the Django project code into the container
COPY .

#Start the Django application
CMD python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
7. Save your configuration.
